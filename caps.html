            <h2>Why Mental Health Matters</h2>
            <p>Taking care of your mental health is just as important as taking care of your physical health. It's okay to pause, seek help, and prioritize your well-being. Whether you're feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or just need someone to talk to, remember you're not alone. Taking small steps to care for your mind can make a big difference. You deserve to feel supported, balanced, and healthyâ€”because your mental health matters every day.</p>
